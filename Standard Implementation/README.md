# Standard Implementation
This folder contains standard implementation of the digit recognition. Majorly 
In this project, we train our own ANN with one hidden layer using backpropagation algorithm on MNIST 
dataset which later can help our machine to identify a given numeric digit.

# More About Dataset

Information, download link and documentation of the dataset can be found on:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The dataset can also be found in Standard Implementation/Dataset

# About
Earlier, in the root directory, we trained an artificial neural network using the backpropagation algorithm. This time, we used standard python libraries to implement the same. The algorithms implemented are:
* Support vector machine
* Naive Bayes
	* Multinomial function
	* Gaussian function
* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
* Random Forest
* Multi layer perceptron

###### How to run: *`python -W ignore main.py`*
